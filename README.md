In this experiment, i carried out an comparison between three variations of ML models, namely, Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT)and Random Forest (RF) in predicting COVID-19. All models used in this experiment were evaluated with different metrics such F1-score, precision, recall, accuracy and confusion matrix. The experiment present a prediction procedure of the COVID-19 status using patients readings dataset sourced from Kaggle, which consits of pataint ID, Temparature, PulseRate and Oxygen. It has four steps: collecting data, getting it ready, training the model, and testing the ML model. The results show all the ML models in this study performed very well. Each model reported an accurate score of more than 0.9. Overall, RF outperformed the three ML models tested in this study. RF said that recall, precision F1 score, and accuracy were 096, 1, 0.98, and 0.98, respectively.
